# Automated News Reporter  

## Overview  
The **Automated News Reporter** is a project that leverages AI to create realistic, high-quality news videos where the user acts as the news anchor. The system combines AI video creation, text-to-speech (TTS), background video generation, and automation to produce and share polished news content.  

### Features  
- **AI Video Creation**:  
  - Generates videos mimicking the user’s appearance, expressions, and movements.  
  - Merges AI-generated videos with custom background footage.  

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**:  
  - Replicates the user’s voice for natural news narration.  

- **Background Video and Editing**:  
  - Sources or generates professional background videos.  
  - Integrates backgrounds seamlessly with AI videos.  

- **Automation**:  
  - Automatically uploads finished videos to platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram.  

- **Legal Compliance**:  
  - Revenue declared according to Belgian tax laws.  
  - Flexible options for managing income personally or through a business entity.
